# ✅ GTD Tasks Dashboard

## 📌 What is this about?

This is a personal dashboard I built in Power BI to better understand how I manage my tasks and projects. The data comes directly from the **Todoist API**, where I organize all my tasks using the **GTD (Getting Things Done)** method. If you're not familiar with GTD – it's a simple, structured way to capture, organize, and complete tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

I’ve always liked having a visual overview of how my time is spent, what kinds of tasks I focus on, and how consistent I am with completing them. This dashboard gives me that kind of insight.

## 📊 What it shows

- Task completion over time (daily/weekly)
- Breakdown of tasks by type – like `QuickTask`, `LongTask`, `MarathonTask`
- Overview of completed vs. open tasks
- Priority analysis and tag-based summaries
- Projects structured using GTD categories

## 🎯 Why I made it

Mainly for myself – to keep track of how I’m doing and spot where I’m spending too much (or too little) time. But the idea could easily be expanded:

- You could connect it to other task tools like Trello or Microsoft To Do  
- Or use it in a **team setting**, where each team member tracks their own progress the same way  
- It also works well as part of a **productivity coaching** or **performance tracking** system

> 🔐 Real data is used in the dashboard, but it's been cleaned and anonymized for demo purposes.

If you're curious how it works behind the scenes (API, structure, etc.), let me know – I’m happy to share more.
