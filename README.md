# âœ… Task Overview Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This Power BI dashboard provides a structured overview of personal task management and productivity patterns. It was designed to help visualize how tasks are distributed across time, categories, and priorities â€” supporting both reflection and planning.

The data was exported from **Todoist** (or similar task management system) and structured manually or through automation for analysis in Power BI.

> ðŸ”Ž This dashboard is built using **static data** (snapshot), ideal for showcasing layout and logic. In a production version, the data could be connected via API for automated refresh.

### Key Features:
- Task completion trends by day and week  
- Task distribution by label/tag (e.g., QuickTask, LongTask, MarathonTask)  
- Task status summary (completed vs. pending)  
- Prioritization and productivity breakdown
