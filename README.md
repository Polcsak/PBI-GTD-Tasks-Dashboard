# âœ… GTD Tasks Overview

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This Power BI dashboard provides a structured overview of task management and productivity, based on real data pulled via the **Todoist API**. Tasks and projects were organized using the **GTD (Getting Things Done)** methodology â€” a popular productivity framework that helps manage priorities, focus, and execution.

The dashboard transforms daily to-do lists into a meaningful visual representation of habits, workload distribution, and performance over time.

### Key Features:
- Task completion trends by date, week, and project
- Distribution by custom tags such as `QuickTask`, `LongTask`, and `MarathonTask`
- Task breakdown by GTD categories
- Overview of active vs. completed tasks
- Prioritization heatmaps and productivity insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This dashboard is designed for:

- **Personal productivity analysis**: Understand how tasks are planned and executed over time  
- **GTD-based task tracking**: Visualize project structures, contexts, and progress  
- **Team-level scalability**: Can be extended to track multiple users or teams for performance monitoring  
- **App integration**: The structure allows for future expansion to include tasks from other systems like Microsoft To Do, Trello, or Notion
